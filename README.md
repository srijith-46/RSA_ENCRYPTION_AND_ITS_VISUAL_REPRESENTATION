# RSA_ENCRYPTION_AND_ITS_VISUAL_REPRESENTATION
I have used Python Program and socket Programming it is a secure communication application that employs the RSA encryption algorithm to protect data transmission between a client and a server. 
The program not only demonstrates the core concepts of RSA encryption but also provides a visual representation of the encryption and decryption process.

Step1: Make a folder put all the files in one folder and save it in .py Extension 

Step2: Then run the server file first, Now the server is open for the connection 

Step3: Open a new terminal and run the client file, the connection will be established in both server and client succesfully

Step4: Now the client can send the message to the server, the server will recieve in encrypted form and then it is decrypted and read by the user.

Note: You can run this in two systems making it as server and client but you should be in same network
